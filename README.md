# Disruption-Problem
Disruption problem consists on modeling a sequnece of time arrivals of some event using two Poisson processes $T_0$ and $T_1$ of intensities $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ respectively. The transition between these processes is done in time $\tau$, which is a random variable of exponential law. Our goal in this project is to give a method that will be able to estimate as accurately as possible the value of this transition instant $\tau$.

In other words, imagine that we have events described by a point process. At the beginning of the observation, events occur according to a Poisson process of intensity $\lambda_0$ until a time $\tau$, and then switch to a new regime which is still a Poisson process but with intensity $\lambda_1$. We suppose that we know $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ but not $\tau$. We assume also that $\tau$ follows an exponential distribution of parameter $\sigma$, i.e $\tau \sim \mathcal{E}(\sigma)$. We want to estimate $\tau$ by the observation of a single trajectory.
